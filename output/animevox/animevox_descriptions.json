The voice has a slightly breathy quality and is projected in a way that suggests she is speaking quickly and with animation. There are no noticeable accents or inflections in her speech, indicating a neutral speaking style. She uses her chest voice and projects her voice forward, giving it a full and resonant sound. Overall, her voice has a smooth texture with a slightly raspy edge.",
